Determine gas-kinetic parameters for half-space evaporation/condensation.

Refer to Vaartstra et al., Journal of Heat Transfer 2022 for definitions of terms.

Refer to Ytrehus' paper (DOI: 10.1615/MultScienTechn.v9.i3.10) for detailed explanation of equations.

Evaporation: input dimensionless driving pressure, accommodation coefficient, and number of internal degrees of freedom to solve for temperature ratio and dimensionless mass flux/external speed ratio. Also outputs beta fitting parameter.

Condensation: input dimensionless driving pressure, temperature ratio, and accommodation coefficient to solve for dimensionless mass flux/external speed ratio. Also outputs beta and alpha fitting parameters.
